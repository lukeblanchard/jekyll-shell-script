# jekyll-shell-script
Jekyll post names require a specific format: `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`. Using this script, you can simply type the command 'post' followed by the title of your blog post.
```
 ~> post New Blog Post
 ~> ls
 ~> 2017-10-28-New-Blog-Post.markdown
 ```
 See my [blog](https://lukeblanchard.github.io/script/bash/jekyll/2017/10/28/Jekyll-Shell-Script.html) for a more detailed description.
